# Leukemia_Detector
using various CNN &amp; transfer learning to detect abnormal blood cells with applying preprocessing and cleaning on the data 

leukemia classifier that detect the infected cells using deep learning with CNN & various transfer learning models
with various image preprocessing that based on MortezaHeidaris paper <paper link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138650562030959X>

##the paper is about improving the CNN models performance by preprocess the images by mergeing <br/>
-the original image with its <br/>
-image after applying histogram equalization algorithm on it <br/>
-image after applying bilateral filter on it add the hog and filtered images as new channeles for the image <br/>

--my updates on paper is that I built my project with trying different fiter, models--
